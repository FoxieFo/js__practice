Exercise 1

- Create a button that contains icon_01 (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-down-left-circle/). When the button is clicked, the icon should change to icon_02 (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-down-left-circle-fill/). Clicking the button again should revert the icon back.

Exercise 2

- Create a button that, when clicked, displays the screen dimensions using an alert.

Exercise 3

- Create a chat interface based on the echo server wss://echo-ws-service.herokuapp.com. The interface should include an input field for typing messages and a “Send” button. When the “Send” button is clicked, the message should appear in the chat window. The echo server will respond with the same message, which should also be displayed in the chat.
- Add a mechanism for sending geolocation. When the “My location” button is clicked, send the data to the server and display a link to OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/) with your geolocation.
